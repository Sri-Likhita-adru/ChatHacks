# VentAI
A place to went all your feelings and get consoled!

## 💡 Inspiration
Most people nowadays have a lot of pent-up feelings with no one to release these feelings to. VentAI acts as the user's personal therapist by listening to all their pent-up emotions like frustration, anger, sadness, etc. Not only the negative emotions but the user can also share their positive emotions like happiness and so on. VentAI basically acts as a casual chat partner where we can vent all our feeling and in turn get consoled and appreciated.

## 📖 What we learned
This is my first time building a chatbot. I had a lot of fun building VentAI with the help of ChatGPT Open.ai API. It was a new learning process for me since integrating ChatGPT into my project was also my first. Overall it was a delightful process to build VentAI.

## 🚀 What's next for VentAI
